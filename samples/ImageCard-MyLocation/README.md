## Features

This card is supposed to help dynmically display content for users of multiple locations. Common use cases could include location specific home pages, or documents (e.g. menu plan). This way, you can use one adaptive card to show content for multiple different users without having to worry about the Viva Connections card limit.

- Supports two modes:  
  - **User Property Mode**: Uses the userâ€™s Office Location profile property.  
  - **Group Membership Mode**: Uses Azure AD group membership to determine displayed content.
- Dynamic replacement of `{Location}` token in card description.
- Configurable external link based on user context or fallback URL.
- Supports fluent UI icons configurable from property pane.
- Fetches images and URLs from a SharePoint list.
- Implements clean separation of logic for fetching user properties and group memberships.
