## Prerequisites

### Grant the service principal permission to the Microsoft Graph API

Once installed, the solution will request the required permissions via the **Office 365 admin portal > SharePoint > Advanced > API access**.
If you prefer to approve the permissions in advance, for example when testing the solution in the Workbench page without installing it, you can do so using the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/):

```bash
o365 spo login https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com
o365 spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource 'Microsoft Graph' --scope 'Files.Read.All'
o365 spo serviceprincipal grant add --resource 'Microsoft Graph' --scope 'Sites.Read.All'
```
